# Face-mask-detector-with-MobilenetSSDv2
This repository contains python scripts for creating a face mask object detection model.
The notebook file contains python code for dowloading, configuring and training an object detection model. 
For this demonstration, I have used the Mobilenet single-shot detector model as is it is lightweight in terms of
training and performing real-time inference on a laptop or computer with low specifications.

The accompanying python script demonstrates how to perform real-time inference with the trained model.
